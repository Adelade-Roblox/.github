# Welcome to the Adelade Organization! 👋

Welcome to our corner of the Roblox development universe! We are a small group of developers committed to creating great experiences on Roblox. Our projects use a wide range of tech to bring unique and engaging content to the Roblox community.

## 🚀 About Us

We specialise in the utilisation of various high-level technologies:

- **Lua**: For scripting and game logic within Roblox.
- **TypeScript**: Enhancing our development with strongly-typed code.
- **HTML/CSS**: Creating interactive and visually appealing UI elements.
- **SQL**: Managing and querying relational data for game state and user information.
- **Redis**: For fast, in-memory data storage and caching solutions.

Our mission is to push the boundaries of what’s possible on Roblox and create memorable experiences for players worldwide.
